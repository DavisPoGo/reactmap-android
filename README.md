# ReactMap for Android

Use ReactMap as an Android app with battery improvements, including:

* Use Google location services to follow location.
* Reduce animations.

Other features:

* See map even behind your status bar and navigation bar!
* More conveniently refresh the webpage when fullscreen. (During network congestion, Chrome HTTP/3 scheduler retries requests at its own pace. Doing a manual refresh overrides this.)
* Login button is clicked automatically.
